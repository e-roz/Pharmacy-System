# Pharmacy-System
Final project for OOP 2nd Year 1st sem
This is a simple Pharmacy system, where in we use the fundamentals of OOP in java which are: 
Encapsulation, Overloading, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance etc.
We also make Simple GUI in this system, to make it more functionable and user friendly
I'll try to put database in this system via SQL but this is just optional
Basically this system should perform the CRUD or also known as Create, Read or Search, Update, and Delete.
